<p style="margin-top:0pt;padding-top:0;margin-bottom:10pt;padding-bottom:0;line-height:1.38;">Our seventeen-year-old son Josh Morgan was diagnosed in March 2019 with cancer after a tumor was discovered inside his brain. Immediately, he was operated on and the tumor was removed 100%, but as a result of the damage to his brain he lost the use of his right arm and leg and he couldn’t talk. From late March until July, he went through rehabilitation and regained his speech, the ability to complete simple tasks that we take for granted, and learned how to walk with a cane. During the same time, he simultaneously underwent both radiation and chemotherapy treatments.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt;padding-top:0;margin-bottom:10pt;padding-bottom:0;line-height:1.38;">He returned home in July and life seemed to be on track towards a new sense of normal. Josh continued outpatient rehabilitation through a center that is close to home  He began a second round of chemotherapy which continued until December. In January 2020, he began attending a class at Shepherd High School.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt;padding-top:0;margin-bottom:10pt;padding-bottom:0;line-height:1.38;">Doctors recently discovered two new tumors which have begun developing in Josh’s brain, and he has started two new rounds of treatment. One is a drug which doctors hope will stop the tumor’s growth, and the other is radiation. Although we are still early in this new round of treatments, we are hopeful that they will be successful.</p>
