Update from Theresa for 3/29:
<blockquote>Due to a delay because of a mixup with transportation arrangements, Josh arrived at Mary Free Bed this afternoon to begin his rehab, instead of yesterday as previously planned. We basically got settled in today and the real work will begin tomorrow. I'm all ready very impressed with everything I've seen so far.

Josh was pretty anxious about coming here, made even more so by his inability to verbalize his fears. After all he's been through in the past two weeks it was very understandable. Despite the frequent room changes, he knew what to expect at Devos and now we headed back out to the unknown again. The staff at both hospitals have gone above and beyond to make sure he's comfortable and understands as much as he can about what to expect and it seems to be helping a lot.

I'll post a more detailed update later. I just wanted to let everyone know we finally made it here!</blockquote>
