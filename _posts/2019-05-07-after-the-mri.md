<p>Josh is back from the MRI. It took around 30 minutes, close to the estimate, and seemed to go smoothly. We are back in his treatment room in the ER waiting for results. Josh is resting, but not entirely sleep. When his nurse asked him if he felt any pain, he said that he had a headache, and that on a scale of 1 to 10 it was a "6."</p>
<p>Josh is also hungry, and his nurse said she would ask about whether or not he can eat right now.</p>
