<p>The MRI results were clear, and revealed a level of spinal fluid which is consistent with a lumbar puncture. The doctors have decided to have Josh ride things out for the next couple of days instead of performing the blood patch. They are arranging transport for Josh back to Mary Free Bed. He will do a little less during therapy to help lessen the chance of pain.</p>
