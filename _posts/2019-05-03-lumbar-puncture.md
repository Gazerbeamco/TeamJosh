This morning started with a non solid food breakfast and then a slate of therapy which included occupational therapy, physical therapy, and language. Shortly after ten Josh and I leave for his lumbar puncture, a procedure scheduled by his oncologist.

On my way to breakfast I passed Josh practicing walking with the cane in the hallway. He has improved a lot since last week.

Right now there are a lot of pieces that will need to come together as we get closer to the start of his chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The goal has always been to get him as far as possible before it began. Treatment is good, because it is designed to eliminate the cancer, but at the same time the process and side effects sound scary.

We continue to stay brave for Josh so he feels encouraged, and isn't so anxious about what is coming next.
