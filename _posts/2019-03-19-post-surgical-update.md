Josh is out of surgery and we are happy to report that the surgeon feels confident he was able to get all of the tumor, something we we weren't sure was possible. Step 1 of this long journey is completed.

Josh is back in his room and is resting. He has a drain to help take off extra fluid from his brain from the procedure. It's a bit scary since they need to make sure they adjust it each time he moves  to a new position to make sure it only drains the proper amount.  He will have this in for several days.

He goes in for a Post Op MRI tonight to see how everything is looking and if all goes well tonight and tomorrow he will be transferred out of the PICU to another floor where we expect to be for possibly another week.

Dr. Madura has said it will take 2-3 days to determine the type of tumor it is and then possibly another week to determine what level.  Then we'll discuss the next treatments.

One of the biggest things in his recovery will be rehab as we don't know as of yet how much control he will have over his right side. If all goes well with his surgical recovery we would expect a transfer to Mary Free Bed for inpatient PT at some point in the future.  So it looks like we'll be calling Grand Rapids our second home for some time to come.

We'd like to thank everyone for all of your thoughts and prayers today. We couldn't have gotten through this day without them.  Big thanks to Jon's sister Amy Gauthier for being with us today. It was such a huge help to have someone here with us.

We still have a long road to go so please keep Josh in your prayers!
