<p style="margin-top: 0pt; padding-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10pt; padding-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.38;">This month, Josh and I were back in Grand Rapids for an appointment with Neurology and Palliative Care. His neurosurgeon, Dr. Madura, noted that Josh had made a lot of progress over the last eleven months.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt;padding-top:0;margin-bottom:10pt;padding-bottom:0;line-height:1.38;">Josh’s school days will become longer when Shepherd High School’s new trimester begins. Starting on March 8, Josh will attend schools for lunch, followed by a business class (4th hour), and then English (5th Hour). He will be working inside the school store as a part of the business class. On Mondays and Wednesdays, he will also be seeing a speech specialist in the morning before his lunch period.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt;padding-top:0;margin-bottom:10pt;padding-bottom:0;line-height:1.38;">Josh is continuing his OT and Speech therapies on a weekly basis at Mclaren. He is working on strengthening his right arm and increase the rate with which he can recall the names of things.</p>
