<p>On Wednesday, Josh's physical therapist Joe taught Theresa how to safely transfer Josh to her car, break down the wheelchair, and then re-assemble it. This brought her a step closer to being able to take Josh to his radiation appointments next week. The final step will be completing her training with Joe before she gets the all-clear for transferring Josh.</p>
<p>This will allow both her and I to be able to transfer Josh in and out of his wheelchair when he needs to get into the car or into his bed.</p>
