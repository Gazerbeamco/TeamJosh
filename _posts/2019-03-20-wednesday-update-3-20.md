Yesterday, Josh’s surgeon said that the best thing to while he was healing was to maintain a sense of day and night, and to talk to him. I read comments from his group and website (I read posted comments to him before he went into surgery on Monday), and then red some dad jokes from a subreddit. He did respond to me by lifting up his hand, and at one point we connected for a high five.

Today, he is communicating “yes” or “no” with a thumbs up or down. There is some hope that the drain in his head can be removed soon.

Right now, we are waiting for him to wake up enough to talk.

On Monday, we worried about all of the risks associated with the surgery to remove the tumor, but now that’s done the concern is that he wakes up. I know that there is never a such thing as a “magic pill,” but I half expected him to return back normal following his surgery. And, all of the tumor has been removed, so it seemed like he would recover more quickly. But, I am learning that reality is very different from that.

The report on the tumor still hasn’t been released.

My sister, Amy Gauthier, has launched a <a href="http://gf.me/u/rj79yu">GoFundMe campaign here</a>. I have also added a Guestbook to Josh’s site which will allow visitors to leave a comment without having to attach it to a post on the site. This might be a way to share well wishes, tell a story, or just whatever you feel like doing. As I mentioned, these will be something that would be nice to read out loud to Josh.

I have also launched a Discord Server. You can use the widget which is displayed on the homepage to join the server. I wanted to add this because I know that Josh is a big user of Discord, and I thought that he might like to use it to chat with visitors when he is able to.

One last item is a Resources section, where I will post helpful information.
