<p>Josh has stayed busy during his second week at the Mary Free Bed Clinic with different varieties of therapy--physical, occupational, and speech. I think that the aspect element of his condition has been the combination of not being able to do things for himself as much, but also not being able to speak. Of course, the whole purpose of therapy is to restore as many of his abilities as possible.</p>

<p>Last night, Theresa sent me a video of Josh speaking. This is something he hasn't been able to do since before his surgery.  So, this is a strong sign that his body is slowly healing, and that the therapy is making a difference. I think that the recovery will go much smoother as Josh is able to better communicate what he is thinking or what he needs. This is very encouraging, and quite an accomplishment for Josh.</p>
