Saturday afternoon went well. During physical therapy, Josh practiced walking and sitting up during his sessions. He was supported by his friend Noah Holliday while his dad Louie and I stepped out for a late lunch.

The extra company was a good change of pace, and it was good to see Josh laughing and kidding around with the Hollidays, just like things were before Joshâ€™s surgery.

Josh has physical therapy again tomorrow afternoon and then begins again with a fuller schedule on Monday.

He is slowly getting better each day. Each regained ability is a small victory. Today I asked him to squeeze my hand with his right hand, and he was able to do it, although it took a lot of effort.
