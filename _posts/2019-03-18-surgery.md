Josh has been with the surgeon team for almost an hour. He was sedated when he left his room. We talked to the lead surgeon, and I am confident that Josh is in good hands.

Still, I cried when I read to him a prayer request I had written, and he embraced me and told me that things were going to be ok.

The doctors will share updates with us throughout the day. The surgery is expected to take a few hours.
