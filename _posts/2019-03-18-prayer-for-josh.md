<em>This was something that was requested for a prayer chain. I wanted to share it here.</em>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" id="docs-internal-guid-6afe4111-7fff-afe5-68db-64510022c4db"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre; white-space: pre-wrap">The Morgan family asks for prayers from the community for their sixteen year old son Josh who is going in for surgery Monday for a brain tumor. Josh recently said that he was interested in joining track this spring and we hope that he has the chance to do that and many other things.</span></p>
