Josh is currently undergoing a MRI just to make sure nothing is wrong. The seizures could be an after effect of his surgery.

I am fairly sure that he will be here overnight. Theresa is on her way over to Grand Rapids.

It was reassuring to see him moving and talking a little more while we were waiting for the medical staff to take care of things. He wasn't quite himself, but better than he was this morning.

Conveniently, he had a scheduled doctors appointment for tomorrow. So I guess we are just here extra early for that.
