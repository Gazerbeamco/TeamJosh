So we are in the family lounge, waiting to hear word on the progress of Josh's surgery.  We did get an update from the nurse saying he was prepped and ready to go. So far, everything looked good. From this point forward, as I understand it, the process depends on what the doctor finds.

I can't imagine being a surgeon, having to deal with so many possibilities at once and so much complexity. I'm grateful that ours seemed confident about the task ahead.
