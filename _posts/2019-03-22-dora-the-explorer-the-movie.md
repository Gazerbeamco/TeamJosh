<p>Dear Josh,</p>
<p>I read today that a live-action “Dora the Explorer” movie is in the works. I know that there have been a lot of reboots and nostalgic adaptations of older shows into movies, but this seems strange to me. “Dora the Explorer” was an okay kid’s show, but I don’t see how it could be expanded into a 90 minute live action movie.</p>
<p>You wondered why live action versions of “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” were needed. I think this movie falls under the same category. Sometimes the original is just good enough. But, I suspect that the studio wants to cash in on any merchandising that can be sold as the results of this refreshing of the Dora the Explorer concept.</p>
<p>Well, the trailer will be released Saturday. As of right now, I don’t know if it will be done with a serious tone, or if it will be more on the campy side.</p>
<p>But, then again, I don’t understand the upcoming live-action Pokemon movie that is coming out. I mean, I get what they are trying to do but I don’t understand why this is a thing at all. I know that you were planning on seeing it with your sister, and I hope you guys have the chance when it comes out in theaters. A movie like this also reminds me of other movie adaptations such as the ones for Garfield, the Chipmunks, and Curious George.</p>
<p>On the subject of movies, “Spider-Man Into the Spider Verse” is out on home video now. I remember when we watched it together there were a lot of parts that made you laugh out loud. It was a pretty funny movie. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was over all. But, it was great to hear you laugh and having fun with a movie. I’m so looking forward to seeing that again.</p>
