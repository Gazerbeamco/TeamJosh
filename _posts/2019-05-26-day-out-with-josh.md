  We broke Josh out of MFB for something
  more than a doctor’s appointment
  today! We took a day pass and at his
  request went to the RiverTown Crossings
  mall. Somewhere he and I used to go all
  the time when he had his eye doctor
  appts here in GR.

<p>We broke Josh out of MFB for something more than a doctor’s appointment today! We took a day pass and at his request went to the RiverTown Crossings mall. Somewhere he and I used to go all the time when he had his eye doctor appts here in GR. Jon, Kayla &amp; Elijah made the trek over along with our good friends Louie, Noah and Athena Holliday. It was a great day, but it definitely tuckered Josh out. Thankfully he has only light therapy tomorrow and it’s not starting til late morning so he’s all ready requested to “sleep in”. Here’s to another great week!</p>
